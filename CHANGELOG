v1.1.0
------

BC Breaks
* MasterSlaveConnection and ShardingConnection will no longer change their internal connection name with their method setName
* ConnectionManager::__construct() accepts configration in third parameter.
* ConnectionManager::connectionNames() now returns all the connection (current and lazy one)
* ConnectionManager::allConnectionNames() has been removed
* The signature of constructor of the abstract class DatabaseCommand changed
* The method MapperFactory::setCache() has been renamed as MapperFactory::setMetadataCache()
* Use methods MapperFactory::setMetadataCache() and MapperFactory::setResultCache() to disable cache. Configuration is checked during intialization of service.
